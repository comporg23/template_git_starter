hey.

i suppose you got this repo by doing `git clone`.

and i guess if everything went fine, this is your private repo.

nobody except you and the organization admin can look in to it.

now create a new file, name it somehow, let's say 'message.txt'.

type `vimtutor` to understand how to do that.

save the file.

add it to your git repo with

```
git add message.txt
```

commit the changes (it's like when you were saving the state of the game)

```
git commit -a -m "this is the comment for the first commit"
```

of course you can write any comment you want.

```
git push
```

the changes should be up in the remote git repository.

have a good day!

you did a gread job. (:
